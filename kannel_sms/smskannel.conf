#
# THIS IS A SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FOR SMS KANNEL
#
# This basic version is used for system testing. It expects 'fakesmsc' to
# send messages which are replied with simple fixed text message.
# It is run like this:
#
#  1% gw/bearerbox gw/smskannel.conf
#  2% gw/smsbox gw/smskannel.conf
#  3% test/fakesmsc -i 0.1 -m 100 "123 345 text nop"
#
# ..all 3 commands in separate shells (or screen sessions)
# Note that you can run them in different machines but have to
# add certain command line argument and configuration variables then
#
#
# For any modifications to this file, see Kannel User Guide 
# If that does not help, see Kannel web page (http://www.kannel.org) and
# various online help and mailing list archives
#
# Notes on those who base their configuration on this:
#  1) check security issues! (allowed IPs, passwords and ports)
#  2) groups cannot have empty rows inside them!
#  3) read the user guide

#---------------------------------------------
# CORE
#
# There is only one core group and it sets all basic settings
# of the bearerbox (and system). You should take extra notes on
# configuration variables like 'store-file' (or 'store-dir'),
# 'admin-allow-ip' and 'access.log'


group = core
admin-port = 13000
smsbox-port = 13001
admin-password = bar
#status-password = foo
#admin-deny-ip = ""
#admin-allow-ip = ""
log-file = "log/kannel.log"
#log-level = 0
box-deny-ip = "*.*.*.*"
box-allow-ip = "192.168.*.*"
#box-allow-ip = "127.0.0.1"
#unified-prefix = "+358,00358,0;+,00"
access-log = "log/bb-access.log"
#store-file = "kannel.store"
#ssl-server-cert-file = "cert.pem"
#ssl-server-key-file = "key.pem"
#ssl-certkey-file = "mycertandprivkeyfile.pem"

#---------------------------------------------
# SMSC CONNECTIONS
#
# SMSC connections are created in bearerbox and they handle SMSC specific
# protocol and message relying. You need these to actually receive and send
# messages to handset, but can use GSM modems as virtual SMSCs


# This is a fake smsc connection, _only_ used to test the system and services.
# It really cannot relay messages to actual handsets!

group = smsc
smsc = fake
smsc-id = FAKE
port = 20000
connect-allow-ip = *.*.*.*
#connect-allow-ip = 127.0.0.1
log-file = "log/fakesmsc.log"

#---------------------------------------------
# SMSBOX SETUP
#
# Smsbox(es) do higher-level SMS handling after they have been received from
# SMS centers by bearerbox, or before they are given to bearerbox for delivery

group = smsbox
bearerbox-host = 127.0.0.1
sendsms-port = 13013
global-sender = 13013
#sendsms-chars = "0123456789 +-"
log-file = "log/smsbox.log"
#log-level = 0
access-log = "log/sb-access.log"

#---------------------------------------------
# SEND-SMS USERS
#
# These users are used when Kannel smsbox sendsms interface is used to
# send PUSH sms messages, i.e. calling URL like
# http://kannel.machine:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=tester&password=foobar...

group = sendsms-user
username = test
password = test
#user-deny-ip = ""
#user-allow-ip = ""

#---------------------------------------------
# SERVICES
#
# These are 'responses' to sms PULL messages, i.e. messages arriving from
# handsets. The response is based on message content. Only one sms-service is
# applied, using the first one to match.

group = sms-service
keyword = nop
text = "You asked nothing and I did it!"

# There should be always a 'default' service. This service is used when no
# other 'sms-service' is applied.

group = sms-service
keyword = default
text = "No service specified"


group = sms-service
keyword = test
get-url = "http://localhost/kannel/smslistener.php?from=%p&to=%P&timestamp=%t&text=%a"


#group = sms-service
#keyword = snapshot
#exec = uname -a >> /home/drakuwa/Documents/development/ednoleto/test.log && date >> /home/drakuwa/Documents/development/ednoleto/test.log
